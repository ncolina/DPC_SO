WHAT FOR? use estate if street name isnt given in making crm based on switch
IMPLEMENT if numbers are the same keep most recent in the crm output DONE

TESTING:output to yellow pages- match with yellow pages file and add class code correcponding to  areacode, number and name1
           can add class code in database(csv) then filter at yellow page crm output
DONE:product field will come from LUT(csv) such that province areacode and type are matched - everything has a product
